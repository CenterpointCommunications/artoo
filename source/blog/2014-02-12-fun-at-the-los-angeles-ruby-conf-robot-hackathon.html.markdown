Our idea of a good time involves a lot of robots, and at the robot hackathon that took place at last week's Los Angeles Ruby Conference ([http://larubyconf.com](http://larubyconf.com)) we definetely optimized for fun. Team Artoo had just shipped version 1.6 of our open source robotics framework, and we were ready to let loose and enjoy ourselves.

As usual, we had brought with us several gigantic flight cases of gear, and robot enthusiasts of all ages were in attendance to program Spheros, Arduinos, and Leap Motions, along with all a fine colelction of other interesting hardware devices. We had even brought with us our Rapiro robot that has just arrived from Japan earlier that day!

Please follow us on Twitter at [@artooio](http://twitter.com/artooio) for our latest news, which might even be that we're bringing our robot road show to your part of the world.
