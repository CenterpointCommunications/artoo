  %h1 Button
  %p
    =image_tag "http://placehold.it/350x250", target: "_blank"
  %p
    Simple interface that makes it possible to register clicks through physical input.

  %h2 How to stablish a connection and setup the driver 
  %h3 For Arduino:
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'
        connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '127.0.0.1:8023'
        device :button, :driver => :button, :pin => 2, :interval => 0.01

  %h3 For Digispark:
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'
        connection :digispark, :adaptor => :littlewire, :vendor => 0x1781, :product => 0x0c9f
        device :button, :driver => :button, :pin => 2, :interval => 0.01

%section.public-methods
  %h2 Public instance methods:

  %h3 is_pressed? â†’ true | false
  %p
    Returns true or false matching state of the button.

%section.public-events
  %h2 Public driver events:
  %h3 :push
  %p
    This event gets triggered when the button changes state from released to pushed.
  %h3 :relase
  %p
    This event gets triggered when the button changes state from pushed to released.
  %h3 How to use events and call them on your drivers?
  %p Pretty simple, when the connection and the driver have been setup (as explained above) you can call events on them as follows:
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        on button, :push    => proc { puts "button pressed!" }
        on button, :release => proc { puts "button released!" }
%section.example
  %h2 Example using a button to turn a LED on and off.
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'

        connection :arduino, adaptor: :firmata, port: '127.0.0.1:8023'
        device :led, driver: :led, pin: 13
        device :button, driver: :button, pin: 2, interval: 0.01

        work do
          puts "Press the button connected on pin \#{ button.pin }..."

          on button, :push    => proc { led.on }
          on button, :release => proc { led.off }
        end
%section.compatability
  %h2 Works with:
