%section.intro
  = image_tag "/images/devices/button.jpg", class: "display"
  %p Simple interface that makes it possible to register clicks through physical input.

%section.how_to
  %h2 How to establish a connection and setup the driver 
  %h3 For Arduino:
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'
        connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '127.0.0.1:8023'
        device :button, :driver => :button, :pin => 2, :interval => 0.01
  %h3 For Digispark:
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'
        connection :digispark, :adaptor => :littlewire, :vendor => 0x1781, :product => 0x0c9f
        device :button, :driver => :button, :pin => 2, :interval => 0.01

  %h3 How to use events and call them on your drivers
  %p Pretty simple, when the connection and the driver have been setup (as explained above) you can call events on them as follows:
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        on button, :push    => proc { puts "button pressed!" }
        on button, :release => proc { puts "button released!" }

%section.how-to
  %h2 How to use
  %h3 Example using a button to turn a LED on and off.
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'

        connection :arduino, adaptor: :firmata, port: '127.0.0.1:8023'
        device :led, driver: :led, pin: 13
        device :button, driver: :button, pin: 2, interval: 0.01

        work do
          puts "Press the button connected on pin \#{ button.pin }..."

          on button, :push    => proc { led.on }
          on button, :release => proc { led.off }
        end
