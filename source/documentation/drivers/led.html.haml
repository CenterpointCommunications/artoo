%section.intro
  =image_tag "/images/devices/LED.jpg", class: "display"
  %p  Allows user to interact with LEDs through digital output and PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)

%section.how-to
  %h2 How to establish a connection and setup the driver
  %h3 For Arduino:
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'
        connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '127.0.0.1:8023'
        device :led, :driver => :led, :pin => 13

  %h3 For Digispark:
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'
        connection :digispark, :adaptor => :littlewire, :vendor => 0x1781, :product => 0x0c9f
        device :led, :driver => :led, :pin => 13

%section.public-methods
  %h2 Commands:
  %dl.methods 
    %dt on → true | nil
    %dd Turns LED on.
    %dt off → true | nil
    %dd Turns LED off.
    %dt on? → true | false
    %dd Returns true if LED is on, otherwise returns false.
    %dt off? → true | false
    %dd Returns true if LED is off, otherwise returns false.
    %dt toggle → true | nil
    %dd Turns the LED on, or off, depending on if it is already off, or on, respectively.
    %dt brightness(brightness_int) → true | nil
    %dd Sets brightness of the led to the specified brightness value passed to brightness(brightness_int) using PWM, brightness can be any integer value between 0 and 255.

%section.how-to
  %h2 How to use
  %h3 Example using a button to turn a LED on and off.
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'

        #connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '/dev/tty*'
        connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '127.0.0.1:8023'
        device :led, :driver => :led, :pin => 13

        work do
          every 1.second do
            led.on? ? led.off : led.on
          end
        end
