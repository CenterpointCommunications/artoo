%section.intro
  =image_tag "/images/devices/leap_motion.jpg", class: "display"
  %p Allows user to interact with Artoo devices using a Leap Motion controller. The Leap Motion uses its built in cameras to track the user's hand motions, and translations those to events that Artoo can use to trigger actions or control hardware.

%section.how-to
  %h2 How to establish a connection and setup the driver
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'
        connection :leapmotion, :adaptor => :leapmotion, :port => '127.0.0.1:6437'
        device :leapmotion, :connection => :leapmotion, :driver => :leapmotion

%section.how-to
  %h2 How to use
  %h3 How to use events and call them on your drivers
  %p Pretty simple, when the connection and the driver have been setup (as explained above) you can call events on them as follows:
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        on leapmotion, :hand => proc { |sender, hand| puts hand.inspect }
  %h3 Example receiving hand motion events from a Leap Motion.
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'

        connection :leapmotion, :adaptor => :leapmotion, :port => '127.0.0.1:6437'
        device :leapmotion, :connection => :leapmotion, :driver => :leapmotion

        work do
          on leapmotion, :hand => :wave
        end

        def wave(sender, hand)
          puts hand.inspect
        end
