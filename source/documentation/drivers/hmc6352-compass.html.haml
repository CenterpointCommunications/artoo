%section.intro
  =image_tag "/images/devices/hmc6352-compass.jpg", class: "display"
  %p Allows user to read heading from HMC6352 Digital Compass via i2c interface

%section.how-to
  %h2 How to establish a connection and setup the driver
  %h3 For Arduino:
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'
        connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '/dev/ttyACM0'
        device :compass, :driver => :hmc_6352_compass, :connection => :arduino, :interval => 0.5

%section.how-to
  %h2 How to use
  %h3 How to use events and call them on your drivers
  %p Pretty simple, when the connection and the driver have been setup (as explained above) you can call events on them as follows:
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        on compass, :heading => proc { |caller, data| puts "heading: \#{data}"}
        
  
  %h3 Example using a HMC6352 Digital Compass.
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'

        connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '/dev/ttyACM0'
        device :compass, :driver => :hmc_6352_compass, :connection => :arduino, :interval => 0.5

        work do
          on compass, :heading => proc { |caller, data| puts "heading: \#{data}"}
        end
