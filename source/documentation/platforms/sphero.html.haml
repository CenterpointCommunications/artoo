    %h3 What is Sphero?
    %p
      Sphero is a sophisticated and programmable robot housed in a polycarbonate sphere shell.
    %p
      The artoo-sphero adaptor makes it easy to interact with Sphero using Ruby, once you have your Sphero setup and connected to your computer
      you can start writing code to make Sphero move, change direction, speed and colors, or detect Sphero events and execute some
      code when they occur.

    %h3 How do I connect Sphero to my computer so I can start coding?
    %p
      Easy we have a guide for both mac and linux in the README.md page of the artoo-sphero gem
      = link_to "here", "https://github.com/hybridgroup/artoo-sphero#connecting-to-sphero"
      , once the sphero is paired and listening you should see it stay a solid color, instead of flashing different colors(not connected),
      once this happens that's it, you can start coding using artoo and ruby.

    %h3 Where can I get a Sphero or find more info about it?
    %p
      You can do it by following this link
      = link_to "GoSphero.", "http://www.gosphero.com/"

              sphero.set_color(@count % 2 == 0 ? :green : :blue)
              @count += 1
              sphero.roll 60, rand(360)
