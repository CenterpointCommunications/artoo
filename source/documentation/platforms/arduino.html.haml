  %p
    Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible,
    easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists and
    anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.

  %h2 What the code looks like?
  %p
    This small program lets you push a button on the arduino board to turn a LED on or off.
    In less than 10 lines of code using Artoo.
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'

        connection :arduino, adaptor: :firmata, port: '127.0.0.1:8023'
        device :led, driver: :led, pin: 13
        device :button, driver: :button, pin: 2, interval: 0.01

        work do
          puts "Press the button connected on pin \#{ button.pin }..."

          on button, :push    => proc { led.on }
          on button, :release => proc { led.off }
        end

  %h2 Drivers
  %p
    Thanks to
    %b artoo
    and
    %b ruby
    it is possible to interact with several I/O hardware devices and interfaces connected to the arduino
    using a set of already defined and easy to use drivers, all of this thanks to the artoo architecture, in conjuction with artoo-arduino
    adaptor (using the firmata communication protocol),
    which makes it even possible to swap the entire platform for something else like digispark, and keep using the same code you just wrote for
    arduino, this just by swapping a couple of lines in your program.
  %p
    Available drivers for the arduino platform are listed below, the drivers contain detailed documentation and examples of what kind
    physical computing (using artoo and ruby) you could be doing:
