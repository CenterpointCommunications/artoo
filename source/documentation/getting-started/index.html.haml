  %p
    Artoo also has support for devices that can work across multiple hardware platforms.
    %ul
      %li
        GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) devices &lt;==&gt;
        = link_to "Drivers", "/documentation/drivers/"
      %li
        i2c devices &lt;==&gt;
        = link_to "Drivers", "/documentation/drivers/"

  %p
    Do you have some hardware that is not yet supported by Artoo? We want to help you, help us, help them! Get in touch...


%section.artoo-code
  %h2 What writing code to interact with robots looks like in artoo

  %h3 Example: Arduino with LED and a button, using the Firmata protocol.

  :markdown
        :::ruby
        # ./my_robot.rb
        require 'artoo'

        # Circuit and schematic here: http://arduino.cc/en/tutorial/button
        connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '/dev/tty.usbmodemxxxxx'
        device :led, :driver => :led, :pin => 13
        device :button, :driver => :button, :pin => 2

        work do
          on button, :push => proc {led.toggle}
        end

  %h3 Parrot ARDrone 2.0

  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'

        connection :ardrone, :adaptor => :ardrone
        device :drone, :driver => :ardrone

        work do
          drone.start
          drone.take_off

          after(25.seconds) { drone.hover.land }
          after(30.seconds) { drone.stop }
        end

%section.installation

  %h3 Installation

  :markdown
        :::ruby
        gem install artoo
  %p
    Then install the gems required by the hardware you want to use. For
    example, if you wanted to integrate a Wiiclassic controller connected to an Arduino to fly your ARDrone:

  :markdown
        :::ruby
        gem install artoo-arduino
        gem install artoo-ardrone

  %p
    If you will be using socket to serial commuication (required if you will use JRuby or Rubinius), you are ready to start
    programming your hardware.

  %p If you want to connect via serial port directly, and are using MRI, install the hybridgroup-serialport gem:

  :markdown
        :::ruby
        gem install hybridgroup-serialport

  %h3 Writing your robot code:

  %p Now you are ready to write your own code. Take a look at the examples directory for a whole bunch of code you can use to help get started. We recommend using TDR (Test-Driven Robotics) with your preferred test frameworks.

  %h3 Running your robot:

  :markdown
        :::ruby
        ruby myrobot.rb
