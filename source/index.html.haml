%h2 About
%p Artoo is a micro-framework for robotics.

%p It provides a simple, but powerful DSL (domain-specific language) for robots and physical computing.

%p With Artoo, you can easily connect multiple, different hardware devices together into a single Ruby-powered robotic solution.

%h2 Meet The Code
%p Artooâ€™s simple code makes telling robots what to do incredibly simple and fun.

  All you need to get started is the `artoo` gem
:markdown
      :::ruby
      require 'artoo'

%p 
  Then hook it up to your robot (in this case, a

:markdown
      :::ruby
      connection :sphero, adaptor: :sphero, port: '4560'
      device :sphero, driver: :sphero

%p And tell it what to do!

%h2 API
%p Artoo includes a RESTful API to query the status of any robot running within a group, including the connection and device status, and device streaming data via websockets.

:markdown
  To activate the API, use the `api` command like this:
  
:markdown
      :::ruby
      require 'artoo'

      connection :loop
      device :passthru
      api :host => '127.0.0.1', :port => '4321'

      work do
        puts "Hello from the API running at \#{api_host}:\#{api_port}..."
      end
