%section.intro
  %h1 What is Digispark?

  %p
    In order to know digispark, and better undertand how it works, we must first learn a little bit 
    about the ruby micro framework for robotics used to interact with the digispark platform.

  = partial "../documentation/what_is_artoo"

  %h2 The Digispark microcontroller

  = image_tag "/images/digispark.jpg", class: "display"

  %p
    The Digispark is an Attiny85 based microcontroller development board similar to the Arduino line, only cheaper, smaller,
    and a bit less powerful. With a whole host of shields to extend its functionality and the ability to
    use the familiar Arduino IDE the Digispark is a great way to jump into electronics, or perfect for when
    an Arduino is too big or too much.

  %p

%section.setup
  %h2 Setting up digispark to work with artoo
  %h3 Getting the digispark hardware ready
  %p
    Before we start tinkering with artoo, programs and manipulating our own robots, we must get our hands dirty
    and build our digispark kit.

  %h4 Assembling your digispark microcontroller
  %p
    %b TODO

  %h3 Installing Littlewire communication protocol in the digispark
  %p
    First thing to do is to setup your digispark microcontroller for communication with artoo. Artoo communicates
    with the digispark using the Littlewire communication protocol (
    = link_to "http://littlewire.cc/", "http://littlewire.cc/"
    ), so we have to make sure this protocol has been installed to the digispark firmware, if this is the case, you
    can start working with artoo right away.
  %p
    Nevertheless if the digispark does not have the littlewire protocol installed yet, you can follow this tutorial on how to install
    Littlewire in the digispark, click 
    = link_to "here.", "http://digistump.com/board/index.php/topic,160.0.html"

  %h3 Connecting digispark to your computer
  %p
    Now that we have the littlewire communication protocol installed in the digispark we can check the USB connection to the
    computer to obtain the vendor and product Ids, we will need this when programming using artoo, this way we can let it know
    what is the correct device to talk to.

  %h2 Installing artoo and artoo-digispark gems

  %p
    Installation is pretty simple, just install the artoo-digispark gem and you are set.

  :markdown
        :::ruby
        gem install artoo-digispark

  %h3 Writing your robot code:

  %p
    Now you are ready to write your own code. Take a look at the examples directory in the
    = link_to "artoo-digispark", "https://github.com/hybridgroup/artoo-digispark/tree/master/examples"
    github repository (or clone the repository to your computer),
    for a whole bunch of code you can use to help get started.
    We recommend using TDR (Test-Driven Robotics) with your preferred test frameworks.

  %h3 Running your robot:

  :markdown
        :::ruby
        ruby ./examples/blink.rb

%section.artoo-code
  %h2 What the code looks like

  %h3 Example: Digispark with LED and a button, using the Littlewire protocol.

  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'

        # Uses Digispark USB board (http://digistump.com/products/1) 
        # with Little Wire protocol (http://littlewire.cc)

        connection :digispark, :adaptor => :littlewire, :vendor => 0x1781, :product => 0x0c9f
        device :board, :driver => :device_info
        device :led, :driver => :led, :pin => 1

        work do
          puts "Firmware name: \#{board.firmware_name}"
          puts "Firmware version: \#{board.version}"

          every 1.second do
            led.toggle
          end
        end
